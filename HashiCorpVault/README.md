# "Dynamic Secrets: Unleashing the Thor's Hammer of FOSS Security"

This repositry delves into open-source tool : HashiCorp Vault that provide robust solutions for securely managing and storing credentials in applications. 
Discover practical approaches, best practices, and diverse perspectives to effectively navigate the complexities of credential management.

HashiCorp Vault commonly known as Vault can generate secrets on-demand for various systems, reducing the risk of long-lived secrets being compromised. 
For example, it can dynamically create database credentials that have a limited lifespan and also AWS bucket short TTL session tokens.

Let's mitigate these risks by harnessing the power of FOSS(free and open source software).
